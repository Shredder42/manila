# Manila: The Savage Streets, 1945

This is the the board game [Manila: The Savage Streets, 1945](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/404179/manila-the-savage-streets-1945), published by Revolution Games.

Images for used were downloaded from the [Revolution Games website](https://www.revolutiongames.us/Manila_1945.html).
The rulebook for the game can be downloaded [here](https://www.revolutiongames.us/Manila_1945/Manila_Rules.pdf).

I have included a few of the optional rules from the back of the rulebook in this version of the game. Those are listed below.
- Rubble (11.1)
- Historical Artillery Support Restrictions (11.4)
- Early Lead Unit Declaration

Manila is a solo area control board game following the U.S. Army's attempt to liberate the city of Manila from Japanese forces in World War 2.
Command the American units attempting to push through different areas of the city. Be careful, however, as the Japanese resistance is fierce and they use several tactics, such as ambushes and artillery barrages, to slow down your advance. Do you have what it takes to liberate the city, just as the U.S. forces did in 1945? Or will the Japanese repel your advance and rewrite the history books?

I had never played this game before I wrote the code. This is a project for boot.dev.
